{"name":"cpuaff","tagline":"Multi-platform C++ interface to CPU affinity management","body":"### Description\r\ncpuaff is a C++ library that abstracts CPU affinity settings for multiple platforms.  It is a header-only library on some platforms.  Other platforms are supported using [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/).  The project aims to fully support all platforms as header-only eventually.\r\n\r\n### Supported Platforms\r\nThe following platforms are fully supported and tested:\r\n* Linux\r\n\r\nThe following platforms should work (and I would like help in testing them) using [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/):\r\n* Microsoft Windows\r\n* OS X\r\n* FreeBSD\r\n* NetBSD\r\n* Solaris\r\n* HP-UX\r\n* AIX\r\n\r\ncpuaff uses the GNU autotools ([autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/), [automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/), [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)) build system, but can be easily manually installed.\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\nTo get a stable release, go to the [downloads](downloads/) page.  This is the preferred method of acquiring cpuaff.\r\n\r\nTo get a snapshot of the repository, click one of the download links on this page.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install a stable release:\r\n\r\n    tar -xzf cpuaff-x.x.x.tar.gz\r\n    cd cpuaff-x.x.x\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n\r\nTo install from a repository snapshot:\r\n\r\n    tar -xzf <tarball>\r\n    cd <tarball directory>\r\n    aclocal\r\n    autoconf\r\n    autoheader\r\n    automake -c --add-missing\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n\r\n### Details\r\ncpuaff builds up a four part view of every processor on a system.  CPUs are identified by their socket, core, and processing_unit.  Additionally each cpu on the system has a notion of its NUMA node.  This allows a developer to select the CPUs at runtime that achieve the performance goals of his/her application.\r\n\r\ncpuaff aims to eventually be completely header-only for easy integration into existing systems.  For the time being the Linux implementation is header-only.  Other platforms are implemented using [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) as an interface to the underlying hardware so executables must link to [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nManaging the CPU affinity of threads within a process is a powerful tool, but operating system provided interfaces are often difficult to use and hard to understand.  To this end, I have created cpuaff which will give an abstract view of the CPUs on a given machine and an easy to use interface to get/set them within a process.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\ncpuaff is distributed under the [New BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) (or BSD 3-Clause) license.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
