{"name":"cpuaff","tagline":"Multi-platform C++ interface to CPU affinity management","body":"### Description\r\ncpuaff is a C++ library that abstracts CPU affinity settings for multiple platforms.  It is a header-only library on some platforms.  Other platforms are supported using [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/).  The project aims to fully support all platforms as header-only eventually.\r\n\r\nTo see a list of supported platforms [click here](supported_platforms.html).\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\nThe latest release is [cpuaff-0.0.1](releases/cpuaff-0.0.1.tar.gz).\r\n\r\nTo get other releases, go to the [downloads](downloads.html) page.\r\n\r\nTo get a snapshot of the repository, click one of the download links on this page.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions, [click here](installation.html)\r\n\r\n### Details\r\ncpuaff builds up a four part view of every processor on a system.  CPUs are identified by their socket, core, and processing_unit.  Additionally each cpu on the system has a notion of its NUMA node.  This allows a developer to select the CPUs at runtime that achieve the performance goals of his/her application.\r\n\r\ncpuaff aims to eventually be completely header-only for easy integration into existing systems.  For the time being the Linux implementation is header-only.  Other platforms are implemented using [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) as an interface to the underlying hardware so executables must link to [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nManaging the CPU affinity of threads within a process is a powerful tool, but operating system provided interfaces are often difficult to use and hard to understand.  To this end, I have created cpuaff which will give an abstract view of the CPUs on a given machine and an easy to use interface to get/set them within a process.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\ncpuaff is distributed under the [New BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) (or BSD 3-Clause) license.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
