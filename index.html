<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h3>

<p>cpuaff is a C++ library that abstracts CPU affinity settings for multiple platforms.  It is a header-only library on some platforms.  Other platforms are supported using <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/">hwloc</a>.  The project aims to fully support all platforms as header-only eventually.</p>

<h3>
<a id="details" class="anchor" href="#details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Details</h3>

<p>cpuaff builds up a four part view of every processor on a system.  CPUs are identified by their socket, core, and processing_unit.  Additionally each cpu on the system has a notion of its NUMA node.  This allows a developer to select the CPUs at runtime that achieve the performance goals of his/her application.</p>

<p>cpuaff aims to eventually be completely header-only for easy integration into existing systems.  For the time being the Linux implementation is header-only.  Other platforms are implemented using <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/">hwloc</a> as an interface to the underlying hardware so executables must link to <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/">hwloc</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rationale" class="anchor" href="#rationale" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rationale</h3>

<p>Managing the CPU affinity of threads within a process is a powerful tool, but operating system provided interfaces are often difficult to use and hard to understand.  To this end, I have created cpuaff which will give an abstract view of the CPUs on a given machine and an easy to use interface to get/set them within a process.</p>
